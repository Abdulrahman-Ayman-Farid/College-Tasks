# Neural Network Task

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a **single-layer neural network**. The task was assigned as part of a college assignment for the subject **Neural Networks**.

### Task Requirements

1. **Create a single-layer neural network** as a Python class.
2. **Assign values to the weights** of the network.
3. Use **different activation functions**:
    - Binary Activation
    - Bipolar Activation
    - Sigmoid Activation
4. The network should have **4 inputs** and **1 output**.
5. Write a `main` function to **create an object** of the neural network class and **test the network** with different inputs.
